Negation: Negation words reverse the polarity of opinion words by checking their position in a sentence. The words are (Not, Never, N’t, Doesn’t, Can’t, Nor, Don’t, Wouldn’t, No, etc). The result will be the opposite if the system fails to recognize the negation word. So, for the recognition of the semantic expression in the sentence, we use the word sense disambiguation to extract the exact or nearest semantic score of the opinion expression
